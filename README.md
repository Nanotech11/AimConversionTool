# AimConversionTool

This program is best used in conjunction with Kovaak's Sensitivity Matcher which can be found at https://www.kovaak.com/sensitivity-matcher
The important information that you get from this program is cm/360 which can be found by clicking "Physical Stats" in the bottom right corner of the screen.
Once your DPI and sensitivity for the correct game are entered, your cm/360 will be given and can be copied and pasted into this conversion webpage.
This measurement can be used in an advanced way by measuring the cm/360 distance while scoped, or getting the cm to the edge of screen for FOV calculations.
This can be done by dropping down the game selection menu and clicking "Measure any game" at the top, clicking "Record" immediately to the right of the dropdown menu,
and then moving your crosshair to the desired location; either the edge of screen or a full 360.
More in-depth definitions and explanations of each measurement can be found by clicking the "?" button next to each text box.
Once you have entered the information needed for each calculation, click the calculate button to get the conversions!
